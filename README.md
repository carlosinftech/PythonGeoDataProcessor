## Geographical Data Processing Application
This is a Python application that processes open geographical data and provides various functionalities for analyzing and visualizing the data.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

The following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- folium (optional, if you want to visualize the data on a map)

You can install the packages by running the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib folium
```

### Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/geo-data-processing.git
``` 


Navigate to the project directory:

``` bash
cd geo-data-processing
``` 
Run the application using the following command:


css
``` css
python main.py
``` 


Follow the prompts in the terminal to select the geographical data you want to process and the analysis or visualization you want to perform.
Data Format
